<h1>The JavaScript</h1>
<p>Information about the default JavaScript included in the project.</p>
<h2>main.js</h2>
<p>This file can be used to contain or reference your site/app JavaScript code. If
you're working on something more advanced you might replace this file entirely.
That's cool.</p>
<h2>plugins.js</h2>
<p>This file can be used to contain all your plugins, such as jQuery plugins and
other 3rd party scripts for a simple site.</p>
<p>One approach is to put jQuery plugins inside of a <code>(function($){ ...})(jQuery);</code>
closure to make sure they're in the jQuery namespace safety blanket. Read more
about <a href="https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/">jQuery plugin authoring</a>.</p>
<p>By default the <code>plugins.js</code> file contains a small script to avoid <code>console</code>
errors in browsers that lack a <code>console</code>. The script will make sure that, if a
console method isn't available, that method will have the value of empty
function, thus, preventing the browser from throwing an error.</p>
<h2>vendor</h2>
<p>This directory can be used to contain all 3rd party library code.</p>
<p>Our custom build of the Modernizr library is included by
default. You may wish to create your own <a href="https://modernizr.com/download/">custom Modernizr build with the online
builder</a> or <a href="https://modernizr.com/docs#command-line-config">command line
tool</a>.</p>
