      Harlon City Server opened its doors to the public on the 14th of December 2019 with what is now known as Old Harlon. On the 17th of July, an entirely brand new world was launched, with higher build quality and a new public transport network with realistic 3D trains and buses.

          With breathtaking architecture inspired by cities the world over, Harlon is an eclectic mix of different architectural styles. Compared to Old Harlon, the current iteration of the server offers highly detailed builds, and if you look closely enough you might spot some easter eggs!
